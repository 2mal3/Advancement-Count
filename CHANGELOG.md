### Changed

- new stabler way to ensure that the score stays accurate throughout player name changes, datapack and version updates and other events

### Removed

- `recalculate` and `recalculate_player` commands as they should no longer needed with the new system
- `reset` command because of the rare use case and complexity required to implement it in the new system
